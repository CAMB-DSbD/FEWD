# Hello-world examples of Promela models 

These examples that might help beginners
to write and run their first Promela 
models.

## Promela and Spin  
Promela is the language for encoding the model
and Spin is the model-checker.

Spin is the program that verifies that the model 
is logically sound (for example, no dead-locks) 
and specific properties (also called assertions) 
of the model, for example, _the model never reaches 
its final state if message ''cancel'' has not been sent and
received_.
