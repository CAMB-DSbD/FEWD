# Programme: Given a Promela model as input, this
#            shell generates the execution sequences
#            encoded in the Promela model.
#            It tags each message of the sequences with 
#            xml-tags. 
#
# 1) The Promela model is expected to generate counter
# examples with messages tagged as in the following
# format.
#<event>
# <originator>buyer</originator>
# <responder>store</responder>
# <type>BUYRQ</type>
# <status>success</status>
#</event>
#          
# 2) The xml tagged messages are stored in a folder
#    called <PromelaModel>ExecSeq-xml where <PromelaModel>
# is the name of the file with the Promela model which
# is typed as input.
#
# 3) By default, this shell generates up to 500 trail 
#    files. This number can be altered by editing the -c500 
# parameter in pan -a -e -c500
#
# 4) The shell asks to input the number of execution 
# sequences to generate, this number MUST BE equal or less
# than the number of trail files actually produced (not
# the number specified in -c500. 
# The number of trail files to be produced by Spin is 
# not known to the user, he or she can only guess. 
# There is no penalty for specifying a large number (eg 3000), 
# Spin will simply stop generating trial files if there are no
# more execution sequences encoded in the Promela model.
#
# 5) This shell is meant to show that the generation
# of sequences can be automated. It is not a final
# product, it can be enhanced.
